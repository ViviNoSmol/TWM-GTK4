###### (here is running the gtk-widgets-factory program and lutris!)

This theme is made for the [TWM-Xfce4](https://github.com/pdn6606/TWM-xfce) & [WME Edition Plasma theme](https://github.com/capYT-real/OneShot-WME-Plasma6Theme) projects.
Its also heavily based on the GTK 3.0 CSS theme made by @pdn6606, its also in beta phase due to issues I ran with GTK 4.0, lots of shenanigans, if someone can help me to fix it, feel free to fork the project (To add, I'm using gtk4-widget-factory to test it)
If you have any issue, report it, and if you manage to fix it, better!

The whole idea behind this is to use it alongside GTK 4 based apps, Us a shame that GTK4.0 Support is missing on both XFCE4 and Plasma themes, so here is why I decided to do this, hope you like it!

# HOW TO INSTALL IT!!
* Do a `git clone https://github.com/ViviNoSmol/TWM-GTK4.git` then
* `cd TWM-GTK4`
* Move the `gtk.css` and `gtk-dark.css` to `/home/$USER/.config/gtk-4.0/` with this two commands:
* `mv gtk.css /home/$USER/.config/gtk-4.0`
* `mv gtk-dark.css /home/$USER/.config/gtk-4.0`
* If you haven't installed any GTK3 TWM based theme, then do this `ln -sf ~/.config/gtk-4.0/gtk.css ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css`
# If you have a GTK4 theme installed do a backup before!
