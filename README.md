# TWM-GTK4 / WME Edition GTK4 [BETA]
OneShot TWM theme for GTK4 

This theme is made for the [TWM-Xfce4](https://github.com/pdn6606/TWM-xfce) & [WME Edition Plasma theme](https://github.com/capYT-real/OneShot-WME-Plasma6Theme) projects.
Its also heavily based on the GTK 3.0 CSS theme made by @pdn6606, its also in beta phase due to issues I ran with GTK 4.0, lots of shenanigans, if someone can help me to fix it, feel free to fork the project (To add, I'm using gtk4-widget-factory to test it)
If you have any issue, report it, and if you manage to fix it, better!

The whole idea behind this is to use it alongside GTK 4 based apps or themes, those two themes are such a blast! But is a shame that GTK4.0 Support is missing, so here is why I decided to do this, hope you like it!
